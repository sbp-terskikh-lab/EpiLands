# EpiLands -- Epigenetic Landscape Image Analysis in Python

EpiLands is a toolkit for analyzing the epigenetic information contained in microscopic images at a single-nucleus resolution. In its current form, this package provides image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and visualization. 

This project is in its infancy and much of the code is actively being developed (and deleted), so expect major refactoring until future versions specify otherwise. 

EpiLands was developed as part of the Terskih Lab at SBP Medical Discovery Institute
